Instructions: 
    The client has asked me to make adjustments to their existing webpage.
    Acceptance Criteria:
        GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
        WHEN I view the source code
        THEN I find semantic HTML elements
        WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
        THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
        WHEN I view the image elements
        THEN I find accessible alt attributes
        WHEN I view the heading attributes
        THEN they fall in sequential order
        WHEN I view the title element
        THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
Plan of Attack:
    1. Update the HTML elements
    2. Rearrange the HTML elements to the proper order
    3. Add alt attributes for images
    4. Reorder the heading attributes so they fall sequentially
    5. Change the title to be concise and descriptive.
